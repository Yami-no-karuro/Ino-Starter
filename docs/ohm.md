# Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law expresses the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit.  
The fundamental formula for Ohm's Law is:

**V = I * R**

Where:

- **V** is the voltage (in volts, V)
- **I** is the current (in amperes, A)
- **R** is the resistance (in ohms, Î©)

## Derivation 1: Voltage (V)

If we want to calculate the voltage applied across a component, we can use the formula:

**V = I * R**

Where:

- **V** is the voltage
- **I** is the current flowing through the component
- **R** is the resistance of the component

## Derivation 2: Current (I)

If we want to calculate the current flowing through a circuit, we can rewrite Ohm's Law as:

**I = V / R**

Where:

- **I** is the current
- **V** is the applied voltage
- **R** is the resistance

## Derivation 3: Resistance (R)

If we want to calculate the resistance of a component, we can rewrite Ohm's Law as:

**R = V / I**

Where:

- **R** is the resistance
- **V** is the applied voltage
- **I** is the current flowing through the component
